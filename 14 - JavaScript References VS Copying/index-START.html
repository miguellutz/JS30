    // --> changing original one doesn't update the other

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players

    // --> team is just a reference to the original array (players)
    // --> when editing original array (or any of the two) going to go back to the reference
    // -----> when updating an array it will always reference back

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    team4 = [...players] // --> takes every item out of iterable and puts it into containing array

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4.splice(2, 1)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person; // --> just a reference to the original one
    // captain.number = 99; // --> will mutate original object as well

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person4 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100, social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear()
    console.log(wes);

    const wes2 = Object.assign({}, wes);
    wes2.name = 'Wesley'
    wes2.social.twitter = '@coolman'; // --> will update copy and original object --> object.assign only does one level deep (clonedeep function internet)

    const wes3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); // JSON.stringify makes object a string and JSON.parse turns it back into object
    // poor man's deep clone (look up performance)
    wes3.social.twitter = '@miguel';
